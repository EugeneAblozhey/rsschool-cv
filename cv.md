### About me
I'm 34 years old. I live in Minsk, Belarus. Now I work at a manufacturing company, but I want to change my field of activity. 
I choose web development, because I think this is the most interesting and promising direction. My strength are fast learnability, ability to perform assigned tasks, ability to admit and correct my own mistakes.
